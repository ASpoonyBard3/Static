# Static
Static is a python application that aims to create artificial traffic so that you can hide in the useless data. It IS NOT a substitute for a proxy and it is still possible to track you, it just makes it a bit more annoying for a would be attacker trying to monitor your traffic.

It's simple, just fill the safeWebsitesList.txt with a large variety of websites that would not draw any attention, the more the better.

Requires beautifulsoup4 to run.

To do:

  Add more websites
  
  Fake user agent so that true traffic can not be differentiated from fake traffic by user agent
